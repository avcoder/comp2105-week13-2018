# Hand out Hiro markers

- Hand out Hiro markers to everyone

# What is AR?

- you have 2 sides of the spectrum
- left side is reality
- right side is virtual reality
- everything in between that is mixed reality
- AR fits in that category of MR, it's just closer to reality side
- so when you see thru you phone/browser, you see reality, but in addition to reality, you see additional objects that are displayed as well
- read it
- field is very new

# Ikea place app

- to show you some examples, Ikea has made this app
- play video
- if you download their app, you can see their furniture in their room so you can see how it looks, you can turn it around, change colours
- cool example to see if potential furniture fits in your decor

# ar.js - gaming

- this is a gaming one, forward to 1:20
- so here's a game, where you're viewing your table, but in addition your table, you're seeing supplemented objects
- you can manipulate those objects in order to win the game
- now it's using a marker and I've given you each a marker
- I think he's trying to get the laser to point to a certain location in order to get the missile to launch

# AR in edu

- pictures of what is happening right now
- left example uses markers. Right one doesn't

# AR for many fields

- can be used for many industries
- if you require safety , you can potentially wear these goggles so it gives you info about what you're about to touch so you don't explode the building
- or if you're shopping, it'll tell you more info about the product

# Waves

- this company has researched the different kinds of technologies that have propelled the tech industry
- so at first back in the 70s 80s, you have the PC - that's what revolutionized the computing world
- then you had the internet and that's what propelled it even further
- then you had mobile
- they think AR/VR is the next big thing, if that's true this is going to be huge

# gartner graph

- this is a company who annually tracks tech trends
- they can predict how long it will stabilize in the market, or if it will fall of the face of the earth never to be seen again
- pick something that's at the peak
- everything on this down slope is on the decline
- but in order to stabilize in the market it has to reach here - the end of the line
- where is AR? it's here. that may concern you but it's not dropping of face of earth because if it were it would go down even further
- so it is making a turn
- some a predicting it will overtake VR

# ar.js

- history
- There's this guy named Jerome Etienne who created ar.js and his mission was to bring AR to the web
- because he didn't like the fact that AR required you to download something
- read the benefits
- so that was early 2017

# June 2017

- middle of 2017 Apple creaetd ARKit
- read it
- this was a bombshell because you didn't require markers anymore - this was the first that had markerless tracking
- hit testing - means this has the ability thru your phone, it'll scan the ground, it'll know that's the ground, and it'll place your object on the ground, in proportion
- monocular camera click next slide

# monocular camera

- all kinds of monocular glasses being created right now

# fast forward to Aug 2017

- Google replied back with ARCore
- read it

# Google's ARCore vs Apple ARKit

- so now you have 2 main competitors, Google's ARCore, vs Apple's ARKit
- both were very good
- Apple no longer had monopoly with AR, which is good due to more competition
- however, read it

# Google exposed AR on the Web

- Google did something nice. They exposed ARCore and ARKit to the web
- so google created WebARonARCore and WebARonARKit
- so now those 2 new technologies are open on the web

# ARCore example (portal)

- play video
- so here is an example of a door/portal where you magically step thru and you're in another location

# ARCore example (robots)

- play video

# As a resopnse ar.js has evolved

- so once all that happened within 2017
- the creator of ar.js asked deep questions - where does ar.js fit now?
- he made ar.js available in something called A-Frame which we'll look at in a moment
- read it
- a lot of the different AR platforms out there (either free/paid), they use ar.js

# A-Frame

- think of a-frame as a bunch of custom html tags that allow you to created 3D objects in the augmented world
- read it
- click link - cool thing is you can turn around, press return to toggle camera,
- take a look a their hello world - this example is kind of what we'll do in our in-class exercise today
- take a look at their docs - this is the special markup tags that a-frame has created
- so basically create a scene and then place objects

# tracking

- there are 5 different kinds of tracking
- the one you'll play with today is marker tracking, that's when you have a piece of paper and the computer will recognize that piece of paper and orient the object on that paper appropriately
- Geo tracking - pokemon
- face tracking - is totally different than face recognition - face tracking is locating your eyes/nose so you can place objects appropriately

# Intro to ar.js and A-frame

- your turn to play
- fork this codepen
- we'll go step by step
